Description
==============================================================
Provides a basic sdk template for Alien Swarm including the following features:
- All specific Alien Swarm code is stripped from the project
- SDK Player with DOD model (from the 2007 sdk template)
- Player Animation State based off the Alien Swarm animation state
- Most of the Game UI is left intact, although the campaign and match 
  making options won't work.

==============================================================
Usage
==============================================================
1. Copy the scratch folder into your sourcemods directory.
2. Open scratch_sdk.sln in Visual Studio 2010.
3. Change paths so the binaries are copied into the correct folder.
     - Right click the server project and open properties
     - Go to Configuration Properties -> Build Events
     - Ensure paths Pre-Build and Post-Build events point to your sourcemods folder.
     - Do the same for the client project
4. Compile
5. Check if binaries are copied correctly into your mods bin folder.
6. Either run pakfiles.bat (in the mod folder) or specify "-override_vpk"
   in the launch parameters. Otherwise some files will be overriden
   by the alien swarm files (like scripts/HudLayout.res).
6. Start the mod, open the console and type "map sdk_teams_hdr"

==============================================================
VPK
==============================================================
The Alien Swarm VPK files take priority over the mod files.
To solve this use either the "-override_vpk" or pack the files
being overriden in a vpk file (see pakfiles.bat/txt).

==============================================================
Alien Swarm Consistency checks
==============================================================
ClientPrecache in client.cpp marks several alien swarm files
for consistency checks (ForceExactFile..) and prevent the player
from joining if the files don't match. You might want to change
these. You can also use sv_consistency convar to turn these checks 
off.

Base Code Changes
==============================================================
Client changes:
- Added preprocessor SDK_CLIENT_DLL 
- cdll_client_int.cpp: basemodpanel include
                       ConfigureCurrentSystemLevel: Changed "sdk" to "swarm" to prevent errors in console.
                       The other solution would be to change the ekv files in the config folder.
- view.cpp: basemodpanel include.
- c_baseanimating.cpp: FireEvent, AE_MUZZLEFLASH -> added fix for thirdperson (might not be needed).

Server changes:
- Added preprocessor SDK_DLL
- npc_combinegunship.cpp: #ifndef'ed GetCitizenResponse() parts.

Shared changes:
- Added preprocessor SDK_DLL
- Added ACT_DOD_ activies to ai_activity.h, ai_activity.cpp and activitylist.cpp
- basecombatweapon_shared.cpp: SetActivity fix from 2007, SetModel stuff (might not be needed).

Misc:
memoverride.cpp: removed _invalid_parameter_noinfo for vs2010 debug mode.

Gameui:
The following parts of the gameui contain specific code for alien swarm, they are #if 0'ed out.
The result is that the campaign and match making options won't work (since they are initialized empty).
Most of the this is related to missions/campaigns.
basemodpanel.cpp (OnLevelLoadingStarted)
vingamemainmenu.cpp (OnCommand, ShowPlayerList)
